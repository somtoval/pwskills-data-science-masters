    "- Ordinal encoding is a type of categorical encoding where the categories are assigned numerical values based on their order or rank. In this encoding, the values assigned to the categories carry some meaning or relationship in terms of their order or hierarchy. It is typically used when there is a clear ordering or ranking among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset with a variable \"Education Level\" that has categories [\"High School\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Master's\", \"Ph.D.\"]. In ordinal encoding, we can assign numerical values to these categories in a way that represents their ordering, such as [1, 2, 3, 4].\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is useful when the categorical variable has an inherent order that needs to be captured, such as education levels, income levels, or performance ratings. It allows the machine learning algorithm to understand the relative importance or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Label encoding, also known as nominal encoding, is a type of categorical encoding that assigns a unique numerical value to each category without any inherent order or relationship between the values. It is typically used when there is no specific order or ranking among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset with a variable \"Color\" that has categories [\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\"]. In label encoding, we can assign numerical values to these categories, such as [1, 2, 3], without implying any order or hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding is suitable when the categorical variable doesn't have any natural order or when the ordering of categories would be arbitrary or misleading. It is often used when there is a large number of distinct categories, and one-hot encoding would result in a high-dimensional feature space."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on their relationship with the target variable in a classification problem. It assigns ordinal numerical values to categories by considering the target variable's behavior within each category. It leverages the target variable's information to create a meaningful encoding that can potentially improve the predictive power of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding typically works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the target mean (or any other target-related metric) for each category in the categorical variable.\n",
    "Order the categories based on the target mean, from the lowest to the highest.\n",
    "Assign ordinal numerical values to the categories based on their order.\n",
    "Let's consider an example to illustrate this technique in a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset containing customer information for a subscription-based service. The categorical variable \"Plan\" represents different subscription plans customers can choose from: [\"Basic\", \"Standard\", \"Premium\"]. We want to predict customer churn, which is a binary target variable indicating whether a customer will cancel their subscription or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to the \"Plan\" variable, we would follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate the target mean (churn rate) for each category:\n",
    "For the \"Basic\" plan, the churn rate is 0.3 (30%).\n",
    "For the \"Standard\" plan, the churn rate is 0.2 (20%).\n",
    "For the \"Premium\" plan, the churn rate is 0.1 (10%).\n",
    "- Order the categories based on the target mean:\n",
    "The \"Premium\" plan has the lowest churn rate, followed by the \"Standard\" plan and then the \"Basic\" plan.\n",
    "- Assign ordinal numerical values based on the order:\n",
    "The \"Premium\" plan is assigned a value of 1.\n",
    "The \"Standard\" plan is assigned a value of 2.\n",
    "The \"Basic\" plan is assigned a value of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting encoded \"Plan\" variable would be [3, 2, 1] for the respective categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is beneficial when there is a correlation between the categorical variable and the target variable. By encoding the categories based on their relationship with the target, it allows the model to capture the varying degrees of impact that different categories may have on the target. This technique can potentially improve the model's predictive performance by leveraging the target-related information within the categorical variable."
