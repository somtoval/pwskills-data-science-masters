The purpose of hyperparameter tuning is to improve the performance of a model by optimizing its hyperparameters, which are values set before the model is trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by exhaustively searching over a range of hyperparameter values to find the combination that yields the best performance. It involves defining a grid of hyperparameters and their respective values, and then evaluating the performance of the model on each combination of hyperparameters. The evaluation is typically done using cross-validation, where the data is split into training and validation sets, and the model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set.\n",

If the hyperparameter space is large, randomized search CV may be a better approach, as it can be faster and may still find a good combination of hyperparameters, even if it is not the optimal one.

    "Data leakage is a phenomenon in machine learning where information from the training data is inadvertently leaked into the testing or validation data, leading to overly optimistic evaluation metrics and inaccurate model performance estimates.\n",

    "Data leakage can occur in several ways. One common way is through feature selection or feature engineering, where information from the testing or validation data is used to select or engineer features in the training data. Another way is through data preprocessing, where information from the testing or validation data is used to normalize or scale the training data. Finally, data leakage can also occur when training and testing data are not properly separated, such as when time-series data is split randomly instead of sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage is a problem in machine learning because it can lead to overfitting and incorrect model performance estimates.

This can lead to poor performance and unexpected results in real-world applications.\n",

If the model is trained on data that includes information on whether or not a transaction is fraudulent, such as a flag or label, it may learn to recognize patterns that are specific to fraudulent transactions, resulting in high accuracy on the training data. However, if this flag or label is also included in the testing or validation data, the model will be able to use this information to make predictions, leading to overly optimistic evaluation metrics and inaccurate performance estimates. In this case, the flag or label indicating fraudulence should not be included in the training data to prevent data leakage."

Use a proper data splitting technique: Split the dataset into a training set, a validation set, and a testing set using a proper splitting technique that ensures that data from each set is independent and identically distributed.
