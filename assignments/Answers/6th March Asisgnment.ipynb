    " - In Investing, Statistics includes average trading volume, 52 week low and high, correlation between assets, classes and securities.\n",

Nominal data can be analyzed using frequency distribution and percentages.\n",

    "Ans - Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. Descriptive statistics provide information about the central tendency (e.g., mean, median, mode), variability (e.g., range, variance, standard deviation), and shape of the distribution of the data. Descriptive statistics can be used to provide a summary of the data and to identify patterns or relationships among variables. An example of descriptive statistics is calculating the average score of a group of students on a test, the range of the scores, and the distribution of the scores in terms of frequency.\n",

    "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, are used to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. Inferential statistics involve making generalizations about a population based on the characteristics of a sample. Inferential statistics can be used to estimate population parameters, test hypotheses, and assess the reliability of the findings. An example of inferential statistics is conducting a hypothesis test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the average test scores of two groups of students, where one group received a new teaching method and the other did not.\n",

    "Ans - Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean - The mean is the average value of the dataset and is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency when the data is normally distributed and has no outliers. However, the mean is sensitive to outliers, and if there are extreme values in the dataset, the mean may not be a good representation of the typical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median - The median is the middle value of the dataset when the values are ordered from lowest to highest. The median is a robust measure of central tendency and is less sensitive to outliers than the mean. The median is a useful measure when the data is skewed or has extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode - The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset. The mode is useful for identifying the most common value in the dataset, but it is not always a useful measure of central tendency, especially when the dataset has multiple modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range - The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. The range is a useful measure of variability, but it is sensitive to outliers and may not provide a good representation of the spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance - The variance is a measure of how spread out the dataset is around the mean. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. A higher variance indicates that the data is more spread out, while a lower variance indicates that the data is more tightly clustered around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation - The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is a commonly used measure of variability. The standard deviation provides a measure of how much the values deviate from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates that the values are more spread out, while a lower standard deviation indicates"
