In the context of predicting house prices, it is important to minimize the errors between the predicted and actual prices as much as possible.\n",

    "If the goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, then Mean Squared Error (MSE) would be the more appropriate evaluation metric to use over R-squared.\n",

    "MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, indicating how close the predicted values are to the actual values. Therefore, using MSE as the evaluation metric would incentivize the model to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values, leading to more accurate price predictions.\n",

    "On the other hand, R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (house price in this case) that is explained by the independent variables (location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.). While R-squared is useful in understanding the overall performance of the model and how well the independent variables explain the variation in the dependent variable, it does not provide direct insight into the accuracy of the price predictions.\n",

On the other hand, MAE measures the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values, which makes it more robust to outliers since it does not amplify the impact of large errors.\n",

It measures the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values, which gives a more accurate representation of the average error magnitude. Therefore, when both MSE and RMSE are very close, RMSE can provide a more meaningful representation of the error magnitude and can be used as the evaluation metric."
