The model is trained on different combinations of these subsets and evaluated on the remaining parts. This approach helps assess the model's performance on unseen data and can provide a more reliable estimate of its generalization capabilities.\n",

    "- Regularization: Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function during training, discouraging complex models that may overfit. The most common regularization techniques are L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge).

The training is stopped when the validation error starts increasing, indicating that the model has started to overfit.
