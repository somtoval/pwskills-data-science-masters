It adds penalty to slop or coefficient and shrink the coefficient towards the zero but not set exactly zero. the major difference is that ridge regression only using for simle linear regression for reducing overfitting whereas lasso regression regularized technique can be used as feature selection."

    "In Ridge Regression, the tuning parameter lambda controls the amount of regularization applied to the model. A higher value of lambda leads to more regularization and can help prevent overfitting, while a lower value of lambda allows the model to fit the training data more closely.\n",

    "There are different methods to select the value of lambda in Ridge Regression, some of the most common methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Cross-validation is a popular method to estimate the performance of a model on unseen data. In Ridge Regression, we can use cross-validation to select the value of lambda that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) on a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search: Grid search involves evaluating the performance of the model for different values of lambda, and selecting the value that gives the best performance. In Ridge Regression, we can use grid search to evaluate the performance of the model for different values of lambda, and select the value that minimizes the MSE on a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical Solution: In some cases, there is an analytical solution to find the optimal value of lambda that minimizes the cost function. This is known as the closed-form solution and can be used when the number of features is relatively small.\n",

    "Regularization Path: Another method to select the value of lambda is to plot the regularization path, which shows the values of the coefficients for different values of lambda. This method can help to visualize the effect of regularization and to select a value of lambda that balances between model complexity and predictive performance."
