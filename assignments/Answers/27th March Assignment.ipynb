Overfitting occurs when a model is trained to fit the training data so closely that it captures noise or random variations in the data, rather than the underlying patterns that generalize well to new, unseen data. Regularized linear models add a penalty term to the model's cost function that discourages the coefficients of the predictor variables from taking on extreme values. This penalty term helps to balance the trade-off between fitting the training data well and generalizing to new data.\n",

We have a dataset of 1000 houses with 10 predictor variables such as size, number of rooms, and location, and the target variable is the sale price of the house. We split the dataset into a training set of 700 houses and a test set of 300 houses. We fit a regularized linear regression model using Ridge regularization with an alpha parameter of 0.1. This means that the penalty term added to the cost function is proportional to the square of the coefficients of the predictor variables, with a weight of 0.1."
