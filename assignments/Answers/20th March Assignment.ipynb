    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Limited Number of Unique Values: With only 5 unique values, the resulting one-hot encoded representation would not create an excessively high-dimensional feature space. One-hot encoding creates a binary variable for each unique category, resulting in 5 additional binary columns. This is generally manageable for most machine learning algorithms and doesn't lead to significant computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preserving Categorical Information: One-hot encoding preserves the categorical information without introducing any ordinal relationships or hierarchies among the categories. This is important when the categories are distinct and don't have an inherent order or ranking. Each category is represented by a separate binary column, which allows the algorithm to capture the uniqueness of each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoiding Unintended Relationships: Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, assigns unique numerical values to each category based on order or frequency. However, in this case, as there is no information suggesting an ordering or hierarchy among the categories, using nominal encoding may introduce unintended relationships or biases into the data. One-hot encoding eliminates this concern by creating separate binary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility for Machine Learning Algorithms: Many machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, support one-hot encoded data more naturally. These algorithms can treat each binary variable as an independent feature, which can improve their performance and interpretability."
