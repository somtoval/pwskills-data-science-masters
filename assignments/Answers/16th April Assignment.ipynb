    "Boosting is a type of ensemble learning method in machine learning where multiple weak learners are combined to create a strong learner. The basic idea behind boosting is to sequentially train weak models on different subsets of the training data, and then combine their predictions in a way that gives more weight to the models that perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weak models used in boosting are typically decision trees or other simple models that have limited predictive power on their own. By combining many weak models into a strong ensemble, boosting can produce a more accurate and robust model that is better able to generalize to new data.\n",

    "In AdaBoost algorithm, increasing the number of estimators (i.e., the number of weak learners) can have a significant impact on the performance of the final model. Specifically, increasing the number of estimators can help to reduce the bias of the model and improve its accuracy.\n",

    "__3. Improved accuracy:__ In general, increasing the number of estimators tends to improve the accuracy of the model, up to a certain point. After a certain point, the performance of the model may start to plateau or even decrease, as overfitting becomes more of an issue.\n",
