    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional tabular relations used by relational databases such as SQL. Instead, they store data in a variety of formats such as key-value pairs, document-based, column-based, and graph-based formats. NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable and flexible, making them a good choice for handling large, unstructured data sets.\n",

This includes data such as social media feeds, sensor data, and log data. MongoDB's flexible document-based data model makes it easy to store and retrieve data without having to define a schema upfront. Additionally, MongoDB's ability to shard data across multiple servers makes it a good choice for handling large amounts of data and scaling up as needed."

    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that provides various features that make it a preferred choice in many scenarios. Some of its features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that it stores data in the form of documents, similar to JSON format. This makes it easy to store complex hierarchical data structures and flexible data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema-less: MongoDB is schema-less, meaning that it does not enforce a fixed data model or schema. This makes it easier to store and retrieve data with different structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distributed: MongoDB is designed to work in a distributed environment, which means that it can be easily scaled across multiple servers to handle large amounts of data and high traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. High availability: MongoDB supports replica sets, which provide high availability and automatic failover in case of a primary node failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Indexing: MongoDB provides various indexing options, including compound indexes and geospatial indexes, to improve query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Aggregation: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex data analysis and manipulation."
