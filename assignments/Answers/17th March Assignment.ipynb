    "Missing values in datasets refer to the absence or lack of recorded information for one or more variables or features in the data. When a dataset contains missing values, it means that the data point or observation is incomplete for certain attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why it is essential to handle missing values\n",
    "- Data Integrity: Missing values can introduce inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the dataset. Ignoring or mishandling missing values can lead to biased or incorrect results in data analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unbiased Analysis: Missing values can result in biased analysis and conclusions. For example, if the missing values are systematically related to certain characteristics or outcomes, excluding or ignoring them may lead to a distorted understanding of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Performance: Missing values can impact the performance of predictive models. Models that are trained on incomplete data may not generalize well to new, unseen data and may provide unreliable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Interpretation: Missing values can affect the interpretation of relationships and patterns in the data. Incomplete data can lead to erroneous conclusions or misinterpretation of associations between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical Assumptions: Many statistical algorithms and techniques assume complete data or have assumptions about the distribution of the data. Violating these assumptions due to missing values can lead to incorrect statistical inferences and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Algorithms that are not affected by missing vaues\n",
    "- Decision Trees: Decision trees can handle missing values by making decisions based on available features. They can create separate branches to handle missing values and continue splitting based on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forests: Random forests are an ensemble of decision trees and inherit the ability to handle missing values. They can handle missing data by averaging predictions from multiple trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting: Gradient boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost and LightGBM, can handle missing values by including missing value support in the algorithm. They can determine the best direction to handle missing values during the boosting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN algorithms impute missing values based on the values of the nearest neighbors. They use the available features to find the nearest data points and impute the missing values based on the values of those neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes algorithms can handle missing values by ignoring the missing data when estimating the probabilities during training and classification. They use available features to estimate the class probabilities."
